# Sam McCormick's Personal Website
*Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness. -- Oprah*

This is the README file for my personal website. First of all, welcome, please make yourself at home. 

This is also my first README, in case that isn't obvious, so please refrain from anything other than glowing praise. 

So this will consist of an html sheet, a CSS style sheet, and I guess maybe a javascript sheet once I learn what that is. 

The goals of the website are as follows: 

1. Include my resume
2. highlight my coding skills
3. enterain and engage the audiance
4. look sick as fuck 
5. work/look good on mobile
6. include animations
7. be unique 

This is also the basis for my personal portfolio website project for free code camp
The free code camp requirements are as follows:

1. Your portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section
2. The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text
3. Your portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects
4. The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project
5. The projects section should contain at least one link to a project
6. Your portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar
7. The navbar should contain at least one link that you can click on to navigate to different sections of the page
8. Your portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens your GitHub or freeCodeCamp profile in a new tab
9. Your portfolio should have at least one media query
10. The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport
11. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport

That's all for now, I will update as progress is made

1. get basic content in the html sheet
2. idea: have a button that essentially changes the design of the website, content the same but styling totally different. I'm thinking a horizontal design, vertical design, and circular design?
