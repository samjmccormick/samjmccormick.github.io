# Sam McCormick's Personal Website
*Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness. -- Oprah*

This is the README file for my personal website. First of all, welcome, please make yourself at home. 

This is also my first README, in case that isn't obvious, so please refrain from anything other than glowing praise. 

So this will consist of an html sheet, a CSS style sheet, and I guess maybe a javascript sheet once I learn what that is. 

The goals of the website are as follows: 

1. Include my resume
2. highlight my coding skills
3. enterain and engage the audiance
4. look sick as fuck 
5. work/look good on mobile
6. include animations
7. be unique 

That's all for now, I will update as progress is made
